# Kubernetes-native connectivity for Redpanda with TriggerMesh, example with AWS S3

This is the code used in a tutorial where we use TriggerMesh to stream data from a Redpanda topic into an AWS S3 bucketâ€”the Kubernetes-native way. To read the whole explanation, check the blog post "Kubernetes-native connectivity for Redpanda with TriggerMesh".

The post dives into a specific example of using TriggerMesh to stream data from a Redpanda topic into an AWS S3 bucket, with everything running the Kubernetes-native way.
